# Week 2 - Project 5 - Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples

## Lists

Lists in pyton are basically what other programming languages call Arrays.  
They are a a collection of single values packed together in a single variable.  
Lists are zero indexed, which means the first value using the index number 0 instead of 1.
Additionally lists can be manipulated after they have been defined. For example you can append new values to the end of the list.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs.  
As opposed to lists, dictionaries are not indexed. Instead they come with a function to look up values by their key.  
Also dictionary values can be changed after they were defined.

## Tuples

Tuples are basically lists, but their values are static, so once set they can not be changed.
