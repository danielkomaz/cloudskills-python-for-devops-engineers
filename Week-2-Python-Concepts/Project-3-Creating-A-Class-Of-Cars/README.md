# Week 2 - Project 3 - Creating a class of Cars

Classes are the structure which defines objects created using thoses classes.  
Every class should have a function called "**init**" this will initialize the class and create the object.

When functions are defined within the class they are called methods.

Methods do have the ability to access properties (variables of the obeject) and also receive agruments at runtime.
