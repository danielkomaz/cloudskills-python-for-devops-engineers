# Week 2 - Project 7 - Installing And Using Libraries

## Using External Libraries

Using external libraries can be done by adding `import` followed by the name of the library like:

```Python
Ã¬mport flask
```

## Installing Libraries

### Using Pip

Installing a library (e.g. flask) can be easily done by using the following command:

```Powershell
pip install flask
```

### Using Requirements File

We can also install libraries by using the `requirements.txt` file which holds the names of all libraries which should be installed with the following command:

```Powershell
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
