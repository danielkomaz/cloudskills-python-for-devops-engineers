# Week 2 - Project 6 - Python Arithmetic Operators

In Python as in all other programming languages we are able to do basic arithmetic operations.  
In the `calc.py` script you can see examples for all 4 basic operations.  
Note that even though we used integer for all functions, the divition is not returning an integer but a float, which makes sense as divisions normally do not return full numbers.
